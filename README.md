## About the Project

The Course Management Platform provides a streamlined way for companies to assign training and development courses to their employees. Unlike typical course platforms where users enroll themselves, this system allows the companyâ€™s admin team to assign courses to specific employees.

Key Features:
- **Admin Functionality**: Admins can add, update, and delete courses. They also assign courses to employees.
- **Employee Functionality**: Employees can only view the courses assigned to them by the company and track their progress through each course.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins manage courses and user assignments, while employees have a limited view to track their progress.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds dynamic interaction and functionality to the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive framework that ensures the website is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.
- **Django**: A robust Python web framework that handles the backend logic, including course management, user authentication, and database interaction.
- **Python**: Used for the backend logic and powering the Django framework.
